# Exercise 11


## Task 1
Since the states and the actions are already given we are having a 1024 states big state space.
This enables us to store the best action for each each state (given the 8 actions). If the setup would be different and more states or more Actions would be needed, then one has to consider memory space or choose maybe a deep learning approach.

### Subtask
Suppos that we had this addtional constraint, we would need to adjust the reward system, so that you would get a negative reward if the blinds is open in those cases

## Task 2

### Task 2.1
implemented with the method calculateQ

### Task 2.2
implemented with the start plan

### Task 2.3
implemented with the go_for_it plan

## Bonus-Task
I was too late, room was already close, my card authorization is too low to enter.
